# Troubleshooting

Before filing a bug, collect a debug log:

```bash
acc --log-level=debug --dump-capabilities > acc.log 2>&1
```

and attach it to the issue.

## Linux: device is not detected

1. Confirm the kernel sees it:

   ```bash
   lsusb | grep -Ei '0300|3151|3554'
   ```

   If nothing is shown, it is a cable / kernel issue, not an app issue.

1. Install the udev rule (the `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.flatpak` packages do this
   automatically via post-install; if you built from source, run the
   Makefile shortcut):

   ```bash
   make udev
   ```

   You do **not** need to add yourself to a group, log out, or replug
   the device — the rule uses `TAG+="uaccess"` so the current desktop
   user is granted access via ACLs by systemd-logind.

1. Check the rule was picked up:

   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/hidraw* | grep $USER
   ```

   You should see your username in the ACL (or the `+` sign). If not,
   unplug + replug the device; for stubborn systems (rare):

   ```bash
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
   sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb --subsystem-match=hidraw
   ```

1. Make sure no other process owns the HID interface:

   ```bash
   sudo fuser /dev/hidraw*
   ```

   Killing the vendor app or a competing tool (OpenDeck, streamdeck-ui)
   will free the device.

1. Run the environment health check:

   ```bash
   make doctor
   ```

## Mouse settings do not survive Apply

The Mouse tab sends the DPI table, polling rate and lift-off distance only
when the device is connected and the user presses **Apply**. Check the log for
both messages below:

```text
[mouse.aj_series] settings omnibus sent: lod=...
[mouse-service] applied codename=... dpiStages=... pollingRate=... liftOff=...
```

The first line confirms that the AJ-series firmware packet was written. The
second line confirms that the host accepted and persisted the same batch. The
values are kept in the per-user Qt settings file, not in the profile JSON. This
is deliberate: profile JSON stores bindings and macros, while mouse firmware
settings are device-scoped.

If the `mouse-service` line is absent, confirm that the Mouse tab is open for
the connected device. If the log says that the device is not connected or does
not support mouse settings, refresh the device list and check the hidraw ACL.
If `hid_open failed` appears, follow the udev steps above before retrying.

## Windows: device is detected but no input / no display

- Exit the AJAZZ vendor app completely (check the system tray).
- Unplug and replug the device.
- Reinstall the app — the MSI registers the HID filter that re-opens
  the interface with shared access.

## macOS: keystrokes from macros are not sent

- Grant **Input Monitoring** and **Accessibility** permission to
  AJAZZ Control Center in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
- Quit and reopen the app after granting.

## Flatpak: device access denied

The Flatpak runs sandboxed. Grant USB access once:

```bash
flatpak override --user --device=all io.github.Aiacos.AjazzControlCenter
```

(Per-device filtering can replace `--device=all` in the future.)

## Stream deck images are black or corrupted

- The device expects exactly 85×85 pixels in BGRA. If you are building
  from source, check that `QImage::Format_ARGB32` is being converted
  correctly — see `src/devices/streamdeck/akp153.cpp`.
- Try a lower brightness: `--brightness=50`. A few AKP153E units with
  early firmware miss the top rows at 100 % brightness.

## Plugin not appearing in action palette

1. Confirm the plugin installed into the *bundled* interpreter:

   ```bash
   acc --list-plugins
   ```

1. Check the log for import errors:

   ```bash
   acc --log-level=debug 2>&1 | grep plugin
   ```

1. Make sure your `pyproject.toml` has
   `[project.entry-points."ajazz.plugins"]` set.

## CI build failure after local commit

- Ensure `clang-format --style=file -n src/**/*.{hpp,cpp}` returns clean.
- Run `cmake --build --preset dev --target clang-tidy` locally.
- YAML / JSON / Python are all validated by the lint job; `pre-commit run --all-files` catches everything before you push.

## Crash on startup with `QQmlApplicationEngine failed to load component`

Your Qt installation is older than 6.7 or is missing the Quick Controls
2 module. Reinstall Qt 6.7+ with **Qt Quick Controls 2**, or on Linux:

```bash
sudo dnf install qt6-qtquickcontrols2-devel     # Fedora
sudo apt install qt6-quickcontrols2-dev         # Debian/Ubuntu
```

## Anything else

Search [open issues](https://github.com/Aiacos/ajazz-control-center/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
or open a new one with your `acc.log` attached.
